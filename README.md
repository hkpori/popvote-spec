# POPVote Open Sources

POPVote is a simple, pragmatic, and secure system for polling in physical voting stations.

It is created by The Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute (HKPORI) for large-scale electronic
polling. It is designed for non-government and unofficial polling as a means to measure and express
public opinions in authoritarian regimes. In consideration of the politically-sensitive nature, the
system must guarantee strong privacy to the voters.

While the current version is designed and developed for physical voting stations of Hong Kong's Pan-Democratic
Primaries in the 2020 Legislative Council election, the system is designed to be useful
beyond that, including support for voting over the Internet like previous POPVote (2014 Civil Referendum
Project).

The team are open-sourcing the specification in Apache 2 license, and we wish it will provide
transparency to the design, security and trade-off of the system to different stakeholders.

The team plan to open source and license the software after the Primaries completed in July 2020.
